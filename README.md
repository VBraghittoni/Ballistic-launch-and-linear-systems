# Circuits-and-movements

Multidisciplinary work on algorithms, physics, and electricity.
Made in the second semester of Computer Engineering.

## Collaborators

[VÃ­tor Braghittoni](https://github.com/VBraghittoni), [Nicolas Birochi](https://github.com/nicholasbirochi), [Henrico Birochi](https://github.com/henricobirochi), and [Edgar Camacho](https://github.com/Edgarcsr) created this project.

## Physics: ballistic launch
Given a target position and an angle of launch, the program calculates the needed initial velocity to reach it.

## Electricity: circuit equations
The program finds the values of variables given a set of equations, which are necessary to calculate electric current and voltage drop in a multiple-input circuit.
